Calic is a scientific calculator using java ðŸ’»
A scientific calculator is a calculator designed to help you calculate science, engineering, and mathematics problems. It has way more buttons than your standard calculator that just lets you do your four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
You can now use your calculator to help you solve trigonometry problems involving sine, cosine, tangent, their inverses, and their hyperbolic functions. When working with trigonometric values, you can change the calculations between degrees, radians, and grads. Also, you now have access to a button for pi and Euler's constant, e. There are also buttons that allow you to easily calculate exponents to the second, third, or any other power.

This Calculator has 3 menus..
